<UL CLASS=CL>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.096</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> Only for MBSEQV4+: support for up to 32 CV outputs (and corresponding gates).<BR>
     Means: up to 4 AOUT modules can be chained.<BR>
     Tested with MAX525 (and midiphy Eurorack Expander), but should also work with TLV5630 based AOUT_NG
     The additional CV outputs can be accessed with MIDI port CV2..4.

   <LI> AOUT port has been renamed to CV1..CV4

   <LI> Utility Page, GP Button #11 now changes to the CV Configuration Page

   <LI> DOUT_1MS_TRIGGER in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file has been replaced by a configurable trigger width which
     can be adjusted in the CV Configuration Page with GP13 now

   <LI> Improved selection handling for midiphy frontpanel:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
       <LI> if you press&hold the Bookm/Step/Track/Param/Trigger/Instr/Mute or Phrase button, and then
         make a selection with SEL or GP buttons, the selection button will jump back to the previous
         function
       <LI> if you press&release these buttons without a selection, the function stays active.
     </UL>

     Example: let's say the track selection is active.
     Press&Hold Param button, change to a new parameter layer, then release the Param button
     -&gt; the selection buttons will jump back to track selection.<BR>

     If it's desired to permanently control the parameter layer with the selection buttons, just
     press&release the Param button.

   <LI> It's now possible to customize the list of labels which are used during track/pattern
     name and category and drum selection. After booting the new firmware, following files
     will be created in the /PRESETS folder: TRKLABEL.V4P, TRKCATS.V4P and TRKDRUMS.V4P<BR>

     Edit these files with the MIOS File browser. Uploaded changes are immediately taken
     over.

     <UL CLASS=CL>
      <LI> TRKLABEL and TRKCATS: are used in MENU-&gt;EVNT, "Trk Inst.", "Edit Name" page
       (Use GP15 to select the Preset)

     <LI> TRKDRUMS is used on the same page when a drum track is edited (instead of a
       track name we configure instrument names)<BR>

       Special treatment: TRKDRUMS.V4P also maps MIDI notes to the drum labels.
       Whenever a new preset drum is selected, the drum note will be changed accordingly.
       This allows you to fully customize drum maps.<BR>

       The first 16 drums are taken by default whenever a drum track is initialized, and the
       remaining drums in the list can be optionally selected to replace on of the 16
       drum instruments.

     <LI> TRKLABEL and TRKCATS are also used when a pattern is saved
   </UL>

   <LI> New option 9/33 allows to unmute tracks on pattern changes

   <LI> New option 14/33 allows to change the steps of the current selected view only

   <LI> the MIDI mixer can now send CC values to a bus.<BR>
     This especially allows to record CC changes (configure MENU-&gt;MIDI-&gt;Port accordingly
     so that it listens to the bus in Jam mode)

   <LI> New parameter layer "Ctrl" allows to change track parameters as documented in
     the doc/mbseqv4_cc_implementation.txt table (previously this was only possible
     from a dedicated loopback track).

   <LI> Recording function considers "Ctrl" layers as well if the assigned parameters
     are changed on the UI

   <LI> CV Calibration in CV page: special handling for Hz/V curve

   <LI> CV Calibration in CV page: press GP7 button to switch between bipolar/unipolar display

   <LI> fixed "lost button mapping" issue if SD Card is removed

   <LI> MBSEQV4+: fixed MIDI export crash    
  </UL>
</LI>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.095</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> support for midiphy Frontpanel.<BR>
     The appr. HW configuration file can be found under
     hwcfg/midiphy_lh/MBSEQ_HW.V4 and hwcfg/midiphy_rh/MBSEQ_HW.V4

   <LI> introduced first "MBSEQV4+" function.<BR>
     MIDIbox SEQ V4+ is a special firmware variant for the STM32F4 core.<BR>
     It offers additional memory and/or CPU hungry functions which can't be implemented
     for STM32F1 or LPC17 due to resource limitations.<BR>
     These special functions are marked with "V4+" in future.

   <LI> V4+: implemented CC layers for drum tracks.<BR>
     The CC numbers are statically assigned for all tracks of the session.<BR>
     They can be changed in the Options page (item 20/26)

   <LI> trigger/layer edit views now also supported for drum tracks

   <LI> reference step for pattern changes now works indpendent from reference step used for sync-to-measure

   <LI> PATTERN page: pattern is switched immediately if SELECT button is pressed, regardless of
     the pattern change synchronisation option.

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new option "Print and Modify Steps w/o changing Gate".<BR>
     If enabled: note values will always be print regardless if they are played or not.
     Changing a note value won't automatically enable the gate

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new option "Print Notes with transposed value".<BR>
     Enabled by default (due to change in V4.093), can be optionally disabled now.

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new option "Swap LED colours" (relevant for Wilba and midiphy Frontpanels)

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new option "Invert Mute LEDs"

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new TPD option "BPM" and "BPM with Beat": prints tempo value and optionally flashes to measure/beat

   <LI> OPTIONS page: new TPD option "Logo" and "Logo with Beat": prints a 16x8 logo and optionally flashes to measure/beat.<BR>
     There are individual logos for each session which can be edited in the MBSEQ_C.V4 file.<BR>
     If you don't find "TpdLogoLine" items there (because you are using an older session) just trigger the "Save" function

   <LI> AOUT: MIDI Channel 9..12/13..15 now set the gate pins #1/3/5/7 as documented (previously it was #1/2/3/4 due to a code translation error)<BR>
     New: gate pins #2/4/6/8 are now set whenever the velocity is >100.<BR>
     This way the pins can be used as an accent trigger

   <LI> V4+ AOUT: support for AOUT channel calibration.<BR>
     In the CV configuration menu, turn GP ENC #7 until 0V/1V/2V/.../Max will be visible.<BR>
     Calibrate the offset of the target value with ENC #8.<BR>
     Press GP #8 to cycle between min/0/max offset of the calibration point.<BR>
     Each V has a dedicated calibration value which can be configured this way, the output will be interpolated accordingly.<BR>
     Note that with exiting the CV configuration menu the calibration values are stored on SD Card in the MBSEQ_GC.V4 file
     (-&gt; CV_Cali &lt;cv-counting-from-0&gt;).<BR>
     You could backup/set/restore the values from there if required.<BR>
     To reset all calibration values: delete all CV_Cali items in MBSEQ_GC.V4, store the file and enter "reset" in MIOS terminal.

   <LI> Bugfix for permanently cleared notes if live recording is used after previous step recording

   <LI> ProgramChange Layer: steps now disabled by default when the track is cleared

   <LI> Whenever a track or parameter layer is unmuted, it will be automatically selected.<BR>
     This option can now be disabled in the OPTIONS page (item 9/29)

   <LI> new terminal command "lcd" allows to display a temporary message from on LCD from
     an external device via SysEx

   <LI> encoder buttons can now be assigned in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file (currently hardcoded to FAST function)

   <LI> STM32F4 board: orange LED shows SD Card available, red LED any received MIDI IN, blue LED any transmitted MIDI OUT

   <LI> experimental: terminal command "backup" creates a .tar file of the entire SD card.<BR>
     Whenever "backup" is entered, a new bak<incremented-number>.tar file will be created.<BR>
     This file can be downloaded from MIOS Studio (might take a lot of time!) or from a computer by
     plugging the SD Card into a SD Card reader.<BR>
     .tar files can be unpacked with "tar xfv &lt;filename&gt;" or with other decompression tools (might be 
     already installed on your computer by default)

   <LI> experimental (might be optional in future): show measure and pattern step position in main screen
  </UL>
</LI>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.094b</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> fixed LED handling for common frontpanels (e.g. MUTE LED stayed active regardless of selected view)
  </UL>
</LI>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.094</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> support for Antilog Frontpanel.<BR>
     The appr. HW configuration file can be found under hwcfg/antilog/MBSEQ_HW.V4

   <LI> enhanced COPY/PASTE/CLEAR functions for following pages:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
     <LI> PATTERN page: copy/paste/clears all patterns.<BR>
                     Special function: by pressing COPY+PASTE the patterns will be pasted into the next slots
     <LI> PARSEL page: copy/paste/clears the currently selected parameter layer only
     <LI> TRGSEL page: copy/paste/clears the currently selected trigger layer only
     <LI> INSSEL page: copy/paste/clears the currently selected instrument only
                    (useful for drums: corresponding trigger any parameter layers are cleared)
    </UL>
   <LI> improved ALL button behaviour

   <LI> New worflow for PATTERN page: GP 1/2, 5/6, 9/10, 13/14 allow to select group as well<BR>
     (especially interesting for Antilog Frontpanel: Selection buttons can be used for mutes)

   <LI> New worflow for MUTE page: whenever a track or parameter layer is unmuted, it will be automatically selected

   <LI> EDIT page: improved handling for chord layers

   <LI> moved some configuration settings which were previously part of the
     MBSEQ_HW.V4 file to the Options page, so that they can be changed without
     a file editor:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
     <LI> MIDI remote key (or CC)
     <LI> Track Selection CC
     <LI> MIDI OUT Runtime Status Optimisation
     <LI> MENU button assignments
     </UL>

   <LI> support for "Shadow Out", which will forward the MIDI events of the currently selected
     track to a specified MIDI port and channel (e.g. can be used to visualize played notes
     with an external device). Select the port/channel in the OPTIONS page.

   <LI> Metronome page removed. Please configure the metronome function in the Options page.

   <LI> Pattern banks can't be modified by default anymore, because they are typically
     assigned to group 1/2/3/4, changed bank assignments can confused users
     to much. If somebody still finds this feature useful: it can be enabled in the
     Options page

  </UL>
</LI>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.093</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> new parameter type "Chord3" provides an alternative set of 108 chords.<BR>
     Thanks to EsotericLabs for providing the chord table!

   <LI> notes in edit screen are displayed transposed now

   <LI> drum tracks: random probability layer now working as intended

   <LI> layers are now initialized for 6 notes polyphony by default (8 layers, 128 steps)

   <LI> optionally pattern changes don't re-send the PC/bank settings.<BR>
     This option can be configured in the UTILITY-&gt;Options menu (item #4/18)
  </UL>
</LI>

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.092</I>
  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI>new parameter layers for track specific root note and scale<BR>
     Root selection strategy: if Root is assigned to any parameter 
     layer of a track, the layer can either select the global root 
     selection ("Glb") or set the root note for each step explicitely.<BR>
     The global root selection is configured in the FX-&gt;Scale page,
     it's either "Keyb" (for MIDI keyboard entry) or C, C#, ... B<BR>
     The local root selection is C, C#, ... B<BR>
     Notes and Chords will be transposed accordingly if the track is in
     Normal mode (and not in Transpose or Arpeggiator mode)<BR>
     Similar for Scale: it can override the globally configured scale
     of the FX-&gt;Scale page for each step.
     
   <LI> new drum configurations: 4*16/2*64, 4*16/2*128, 4*16/1*256

   <LI> new configuration option in Track Mode page: "Note Last/First"<BR>
     Allows to specify, if the transposer should take the last or first
     played note (previously it always played the last note)

   <LI> new configuration option in Track Mode page: "STrg" (Step Trigger).<BR>
     If activated, the step progression will be controlled from the transposer
     bus, hence it can either be triggered from a loopback track or from an 
     external MIDI device (MIDI keyboard, sequencer, etc.)<BR>
     Note that each track can be assigned to a dedicated transpose bus
     (4 busses are available), this allows to control 4 independent step progressions
     for all 16 tracks.

   <LI> individual steps of CC, PitchBender, Program Change and Aftertouch
     layers can now be disabled so that they won't play.<BR>
     Turn the encoder to the rightmost position (value 128)<BR>
     Also the init value has been changed: for these layers, the steps
     are now disabled by default.<BR>
     For CCs please change the init value by yourself in the UTIL-&gt;OPT
     page (option #12: Initial CC value)

   <LI> new behaviour of CLEAR button in recording mode:<BR>
     it clears only the selected step (instead of the entire pattern).
     During live recording it will clear the "played" steps while the
     button is pressed.

   <LI> new CC functions which can be configured in MIDI-&gt;ExtCtrl. page:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
       <LI>Play/Stop: allows to assign the PLAY button to a CC
       <LI>Record: allows to assign the RECORD button to a CC
     </UL>

   <LI> MBSEQ_HW.V4: added new button/LED functions: FX, MOVE, SCROLL

   <LI> MBSEQ_HW.V4: added new LED_MEASURE function which will activate a LED
     when the first step of the measure is played.

   <LI> CC Parameter layer label now prints "#<number>" instead of "CC"

   <LI> Jam page: AStart now starts to record into first step in 
     live recording mode (as intended), it starts on the selected step
     in step recording mode

   <LI> Purpose of Record and Live Button & LED change:<BR>
     they switch between record (and live) mode w/o changing to the Jam page

   <LI> new button/LED combo: JAM_LIVE and JAM_STEP: they switch to the JAM
     page and select Live resp. Step recording mode

   <LI> BLM16x16+X keyboard can now record into any track

   <LI> Transpose page now allows selection based on Scale

     (empty or trigger on each 4th step)

   <LI> Event configuration page: new drum track configuration 2*64/2*128

   <LI> AOUT: added suskey function (AKA fingered portamento: slew rate only
     enabled if more than 2 keys are played)<BR>
     This function can be enabled in the CV Configuration page

   <LI> removed obsolete (non-working) pattern based scale control

   <LI> fixed LED behaviour in Step View page (corrected display if page is deselected)

   <LI> various minor bugfixes & improvements

     half of the page

   <LI> Track duplication now also possible with COPY+PASTE in UTILITY page

   <LI> Track selections (Parameter/Trigger Layer, instrument, step view)
     can now be handled individually for each track.<BR>
     This function can be enabled in the UTILITY-&gt;Opt menu (item #9/16)

   <LI> added BLM fader configuration to UTILITY-&gt;Opt menu (item #14/16)<BR>
     Up to 8 faders can be connected to the BLM16x16+X<BR>
     They can send a CC value either to a statically assigned Port/Chn, or to
     the Port/Chn defined by the track.<BR>
     Optionally value can be sent with inverted polarity (turn encoder beyond CC#127).<BR>
     Additional (internal) functions can be added in future.

   <LI> BLM in keyboard mode: transpose only takes place if track not in normal
     (no transpose) mode!

   <LI> if a track plays a sustained note, and doesn't play a step anymore
     (all gates cleared), the sustain will be cancled now

   <LI> improved Auto Start in Jam page

   <LI> Jam recording options are now stored/restored in/from session 
     configuration file

   <LI> SONG button has now the same function like the SELECT button: it shows
     a configuration page. This makes it more consistent to the EDIT button.
     In future, the SELECT button might get a new function in SONG page.

   <LI> Song mode: if Steps per Measure < Steps for Pattern synchronisation, the
     song sequencer will already switch to the next pattern with the next measure.

   <LI> BLM16x16+X support for Mute and Solo.<BR>
     The new functions are available at Extra Row Button #3 and #4
     (if a BLM16x8+X is connected, they replace Start/Stop at Extra Row Button #1 and #2)<BR>

     If Mute active: the extra column buttons mute/unmute tracks<BR>
     If Solo active: the extra column buttons solo/unsolo tracks<BR>

     LED Colour coding:<BR>

     If activated, these parameters will be sent when the sequencer is started and on pattern changes.<BR>
     Please note: a program and bank change can stall your synth so that the first note could be delayed!
     Use this function only when the device can handle patch changes quickly!

   <LI> added CV_GATE_SR1 and CLK_SR to MBSEQ_HW.V4 config<BR>
     This is the prefered option to add CV gates and DIN clock/start signals to your MIDIbox SEQ in future.
     See also updated <A HREF="http://www.ucapps.de/midibox_seq_manual_hw.html">HW section in the user manual</A>.

   <LI> 8 individual DIN Sync clock outputs with individual divider and pulsewidth values are

       <LI> predefined MIDI events, stored in the track layers, should be manually
       triggered (and not sequenced).<BR>
       E.g. in conjunction with a sampler, you could set each step to a note
       which "fires" a certain sample. In addition, you can fire CCs,
       Program Change, Aftertouch etc. from the MANUAL page.

       <LI> the track should be controlled from an analog modulation source (e.g. a
       sawwave from a LFO). MIDIbox SEQ doesn't provide analog inputs, so that
       an external CV-to-MIDI interface is required.<BR>
       Note that this interface also has to scale the CC value over the desired
       step range. If the modulation source should sweep over step 1..16, then
       the CV-to-MIDI interface has to scale down the converted value to the
       CC value range 0..15!

  <UL CLASS=CL>
   <LI> removed MSD (mass storage device) mode to save some memory.<BR>
     With the MIOS Filebrowser (integrated into MIOS Studio) this mode has a good
     replacement meanwhile. For direct access to the SD Card another application (like
     MIDIO128) could be temporary uploaded... or the SD Card can be plugged into
     a common SD Card reader.

   <LI> Options page has been overworked, so that more options can be added in future

   <LI> experimental: if Live mode or a MIDI Router based "Track" or "Sel.Trk" is active,
     and Note, CC, PitchBender, Program Change is received on the selected IN Port,
     the corresponding track layer (or LFO CC) will be muted completely, or temporary
     for a given number of steps.
     This allows to temporary overrule events generated by the sequencer from
     an external MIDI keyboard or controller.<BR>
     This feature has to be configured in the UTILITY-&gt;Options page, it's disabled by default!

   <LI> activate the ALL function (press ALL button) in the mute page to get a new 
     menu page which allows to mute/unmute all tracks, layers of current track or 
     mute&layers of all tracks.<BR>
     Sidenote: this obsoletes the UTILITY-&gt;MUTE and UNMUTE function, which might
     be replaced by something else in future.

   <LI> the 6 new mute/unmute functions are now also accessible from dedicated buttons
     (and LEDs). They have to be assigned in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file.

   <LI> it's now possible to control the track mutes via CCs.<BR>
     The first CC (for the first track) has to be configured in the MENU-&gt;MIDI-&gt;Ext.Ctrl
     page. The remaining tracks are controlled from the 15 consecutive CCs.<BR>
     E.g. if the CC number is set to 16, the mutes of track 1-16 are controlled with
     CC#16 .. CC#31

   <LI> it's now possible to dump a mixer map via CC. The CC has to be configured in the 
     MENU-&gt;MIDI-&gt;Ext.Ctrl page.

   <LI> a CC assigned to a sequencer layer won't be sent if it's also assigned to
     the LFO "Extra CC"

   <LI> if a track is initialized, CC layers will be assigned to "off" by default
     (no CC will be sent). The desired CC number has to be set explicitly before a
     CC layer will send an event.

   <LI> in record mode, incoming CC events will be automatically assigned to free CC 
     layers so that no pre-configuration is required (like known from MBSEQ V4L).
     A CC layer is "free" (unassigned) as long as the CC number is turned "off". This
     is the default setting for all CC layers after initialisation, and can be changed
     in the MENU-&gt;EVENT page if desired.

   <LI> it's now possible to send parameter changes, done from the user interface,
     to a specified MIDI output port. This allows to record such changes with a DAW.<BR>
     The output port has to be selected in the MIDI-&gt;Ext.Ctrl page, where also the
     input port and channel is specified.

   <LI> a very useful "quick save" function has been added which significantly improves
     the song phrases handling.<BR>

     The new function will store the current mixer and pattern setup into predefined
     bank positions:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
       <LI> Phrase A will use Mixer Map #1 and Patterns 1:A1 2:A1 3:A1 4:A1
       <LI> Phrase B will use Mixer Map #2 and Patterns 1:A2 2:A2 3:A2 4:A2
       <LI> Phrase C will use Mixer Map #3 and Patterns 1:A3 2:A3 3:A3 4:A3
       <LI> ...
       <LI> Phrase P will use Mixer Map #16 and Patterns 1:B8 2:B8 3:B8 4:B8
     </UL>

     After the store operation, following references will be copied into the phrase
     slot of the song:
     <UL CLASS=CL>
       <LI> 1st phrase step: the current mutes
       <LI> 2nd phrase step: selects the new mixer map
       <LI> 3rd phrase step: selects the new pattern set
       <LI> 4th phrase step: jumps to the 3rd phrase step (could be useful in song mode)
     </UL>

     How to use this function:<BR>
     Start a new session, edit some tracks, start jamming.<BR>
     Whenever you've found sequences which play well together, change to the SONG page,
     press&amp;hold the SELECT button, then select "Save&amp;Take over Patterns" with GP button 16.<BR>
     Thereafter release the SELECT button, and select the target phrase slot with
     one of the GP buttons -&gt; this will store the current mutes/mixer map/patterns
     into the predefined bank positions and insert references into the phrase slot.<BR>

     Now you can continue jamming, change tracks, change mixer values, change mutes.<BR>
     Whenever you found a new nice working sequence, go to the SONG page and store
     it into another phrase slot (or overwrite an existing slot).<BR>

     The stored phrases can be restored as usual with the GP buttons in the song page.

   <LI> it's now possible to specify the initial CC value (for the CLEAR and INIT
     function) in the UTILITY-&gt;Options page

    port setting will be copied as well.<BR>
    This allows to copy&paste a complete track from one pattern to another.

  <LI> Paste/Clr steps/track setting in options menu is now a global setting and will
    be written into MBSEQ_GC.V4 instead of (the session specific) MBSEQ_C.V4 file.<BR>
    In future versions it might be a good idea to move global settings into a separate menu page.

  <LI> the simple Transpose/Arpeggiator MIDI split function has been replaced by 
    a new bus routing concept.<BR>

    There are 4 busses that can be configured in the MIDI page.<BR>
    Each bus provides a dedicated MIDI port, channel and lower/upper MIDI note
    to define a keyboard range.</LI>

  <LI> the bus can either be routed to the transpose/arpeggiator function ("T&A Mode"),
    or it can be used to play the currently selected track "live" ("Play Mode")</LI>

  <LI> Track Mode page: now allows to select the bus over that the transpose/arpeggiator
    function should be controlled</LI>

  <LI> Record function: whenever active, the MIDI port and channel used for recording
    won't be routed to Transpose/Arpeggiator/Play bus.</LI>

  <LI> the "Roll" trigger now selects a 2D10 roll instead of 3D08 since it's more
    useful in most cases.<BR>
    In order to apply customized roll values, please use the roll function of
    the parameter layer instead of the Roll trigger.</LI>

  <LI> implemented "Roll2" parameter layer function.<BR>
    This alternative solution to "Roll" allows to define the number of step repeats,
    and the distance between them.</LI>

  <LI> added optional button/LED function for UNDO</LI>

  <LI> fixed MIDI clock issue sent to USB5..USB8 (resulted into multiplied tempo 
    values in some DAWs)</LI>

  <LI> CC assignment displayed correctly in mixer page</LI>

  <LI> LFO CC not sent anymore if track is muted</LI>

  <LI> fixed crash if preset name is longer than 7 characters</LI>

  <LI> fixed step selection of copy function</LI>

  <LI> inverted encoder behaviour in mute page: moving clockwise will unmute,
    moving counter clockwise will activate mute</LI>

  <LI> if a previously "empty" pattern/map/song is stored without name, it will be
    labled with "unnamed" now.</LI>

  <LI> LFO effect now works on CC parameters as intended</LI>

  <LI> If a track is in CC mode, a CC/Pitchbender value will only be sent if
    the gate trigger is set.<BR>
    CCs/Pitchbender events are sent for each step regardless of the gate
    as before if the track is in Note or Chord mode.</LI>

  <LI> transpose now works correctly on CC and Pitchbender values, but only if the
    track is configured for CC mode.<BR>
    Transpose will be ignored for CC/Pitchbender events if track is in
    Note or Chord mode.</LI>

  <LI> there is now a separate port/channel setting for recording, it can be
    directly changed in the UTILITY-&gt;RECORD page

  <LI> the MIDI file import function now starts with the first track that contains
    MIDI events to ensure that MIDI file tracks are aligned properly to MBSEQ tracks.<BR>
    This is a workaround if the DAW uses the first track as a "master track" to 
    store tempo informations. Previously this always resulted into an empty 
    G1T1 track, and sequences started at G1T2.

<IMG SRC="images/1x1dot.gif" height=20 ALT=""><BR>
<LI><I>V4.0beta19</I>
  <UL>
  <LI> changed order of instruments in initial drum map<BR>
    (HiHats now at position 3, 4 and 5)

  <LI>implemented MIDI file import function (UTILITY-&gt;DISK-&gt;IMPORT)<BR>

    MIDI files have to be copied into the /midi directory of the SD Card.<BR>

    All tracks are imported at once (up to 16) in the same order they are stored
    in the .mid file. Accordingly, track assignments can be done within the
    .mid file before it is imported (e.g. edit the .mid file with your DAW)<BR>

    Currently only MIDI Notes and drums are supported (no CCs, no Pitchbender).<BR>

    To import drum tracks, change the import mode from "Note" to "Drum". This
    mode especially allows to control the velocity of each step separately.
    Currently drum instruments are only mapped to a pre-selection of 4/8/16
    notes - this map cannot be customized yet!<BR>

    Since MIDIbox SEQ is a step sequencer, notes will be quantised with a
    selectable resolution (16th, 32th or 64th).<BR>

    Also the number of layers/drum instruments is selectable (4, 8 or 16). <BR>
    Than more layers are available, than more notes can be played at the 
    same step. In "Note" mode, all notes share the same velocity and length 
    value, in "Drum" mode each step and instrument has a dedicated velocity
    value.<BR>

    If the imported track contains different velocity or length values for
    polyphonic played notes, and this characteristic is important, it is 
    recommended to split the track into multiple pieces (e.g. for long and
    for short notes) and to import them into separate MBSEQ tracks.<BR>

    Another hint: if notes of the imported track don't start exactly at the
    16th/32th/64th note position (e.g. because they have a "swing" feel), it
    is recommended to quantize the notes in a DAW before the import.<BR>
    The swing feel can be added again after the import (GROOVE page).<BR>

    All tracks will be initialized depending on the selected resolution and
    layers before the import is started. Than higher the resolution, or than more
    layers are selected, than less bars can be imported (number of bars is displayed
    on screen).<BR>

    The MIDI port will always be set to DEFAULT during import. The MIDI channel will
    be set to the channel of the first played note (for each track separately).<BR>

    MIDI Files can be imported while the sequencer is running. This allows you to
    search for a certain file, but also to try different parameters during runtime.<BR>

    Each group (G1/2/3/4) has a separate selection zone on the keyboard.
    Key C..B select section 1..12, the first key of the octave (C) plays
    the first section as usual, it has the same effect as if this feature
    is disabled.<BR>

    The width of a section depends on the track length.<BR>

    E.g., if the track length is set to 32, and if it consists of 256 steps,
    8 sections are available which can be selected with Key C/C#/D/D#/E/F#/F/F#/G<BR>


    It is recommended to activate the "Follow" function under UTILITY-&gt;OPTIONS

    Now copy .syx files into these directories which should be sent to the
    devices later.<BR>

    Thats all! On your MIDIbox SEQ, change to the MENU-&gt;SYSEX menu, the
    devices will be displayed on screen. Select a device to browse through
    the file list. Select a file to send the dump.<BR>

    Note: currently .syx files are only sent to the Default port (selected in
    MIDI page). A "store .syx dump" function is planned for later releases.<BR>

  <LI> added new info page "About this MIDIbox" (at the end of menu list) to
    simplify support.<BR>
    A lot of additional informations are sent to the MIOS Terminal when 
    an item (displayed at left page) is selected with a GP or the SELECT
    button. Use the datawheel or a GP encoder to browse through the list.<BR>

    MIOS Terminal is part of MIOS Studio, a command line tool for MacOS 
    available as well.

  <LI> Length 128/256 quick selection won't be displayed anymore if track

  <LI>if global loop mode enabled, a "*LOOPED*" message will flash at the 
    right corner of the EDIT and STEPVIEW screen.
  <LI> following handling has been added to realize a "smooth startup" for
    people who are in the progress of building their MBSEQ. The core is already
    running, they connect a SD Card but don't have LCDs (so that messages
    cannot be read):
    <UL>
      <LI> if a SD Card without Banks/Songs/Mixer Maps is connected, the appr.
        files won't be created automatically anymore.
      <LI> messages are print on the PATTERN/SONG and MIXER page to inform
        that files have to be created from the UTILITY-&gt;DISK menu
      <LI> in the DISK-&gt;UTILITY menu you will find a special option at the left
        side which allows to start the formatting process (in fact, the SD
        Card won't be formatted, but some files will be created)
      <LI> there is now a nice progress bar which informs about the state
        as long as formatting is in progress

  <LI> Song/Phrase mode not switched via SONG button anymore (this handling
    is an artifact from MBSEQ V2/V3)<BR>
    Instead, the mode can be changed with GP encoder #8 or #9
  <LI> a 16 step selection pattern for the ALL function is now available
    (only selected steps will be touched by the ALL function).<BR>
    It can be changed by pressing the SELECT button in EDIT page.
  <LI> the 16 instrument labels of a drum track can be edited now

    <LI> firmware completely rewritten in C - it can be optionally emulated under MacOS
    <LI> patterns/songs/grooves/configs/etc. now stored on SD Card in a FAT32 filesystem
    <LI> USB MIDI natively supported, MIDI events are sent more than 100 times faster to a DAW/virtual synth
    <LI> two "common" MIDI IN and MIDI OUT ports, up to 8 additional MIDI OUT ports can be added with MBHP_IIC_MIDI modules
    <LI> track length increased to 256 steps
    <LI> track memory can be partitioned, e.g. 64 steps and 16 parameter layers, or 256 steps and 4 parameter layers. Each track provides 8 trigger layers
    <LI> resolution increased to 384ppqn (16 times faster than common MIDI clock)
    <LI> new MIDI event scheduler concept priorises and sorts queued MIDI events
    <LI> new parameter layer options like "Pitch Wheel", "Roll" and "Probability"
    <LI> special drum mode for easier editing of percusive patterns
    <LI> additional chords (now: 32 in Major/Minor scale)
    <LI> new track progression parameters like "Interval/Repeat/Skip"
    <LI> groove templates can now be customized and stored on SD Card
    <LI> Echo Fx with variable number of repeats, damp, tempo change, note incrementer (can be forced to scale!)
    <LI> LFO Fx with different waveforms, synchronized to track clock, step based selection of period and reset, assignable to Note/Velocity/Length + separate CC with definable ppqn resolution
    <LI> value range Limiter Fx
    <LI> Loop Fx (also nice for editing)
    <LI> overworked realtime record function with better quantisation
    <LI> hardware configuration file now read from SD Card. No need to recompile the firmware on changes.
