<H1>User Manual --- Menu Pages</H1>

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Edit Page </H2>
<P CLASS=DESC>This is the main page which is visible after startup. From any other menu page you can always go back to this page by pushing the EDIT button.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
The <B>upper line</B> shows following informations:
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>G1T1:</B> the group/track number (1,2,3,4) which is displayed in most menu pages at upper left corner. If multiple groups and/or tracks are selected, a M is displayed instead of the number.<BR>
The track group can be changed in the PATTERN menu, with the TrackSel (F4) button or with the 4 optional GROUP buttons (not part of the original MBSEQ V2/V3 frontpanel, but part of the MIDIbox SEQ V4 panel)<BR>
The track can be changed with the 4 TRACK buttons</LI>
  <LI><B>Chn 1/Def:</B> the MIDI channel and MIDI port to which the track is sending.</LI>
  <LI><B>A:Note:</B> the active layer (A,B,C,..P), and the parameter which is assigned to the layer.<BR>
The parameter layer can be selected with the 3 LAYER buttons. Layer C button either toggles between C and D, or it shows a selection page for all parameter layers if the track is partitioned for more than 4 layers.</LI>
  <LI><B>A:Gate:</B> the active trigger layer (A,B,C,..H), and the trigger function which is assigned to the layer<BR>
The trigger layer can selected with the TrgSel (F3) button, or with the optional Trigger Selection buttons which are part of the MIDIbox SEQ V4 frontpanel.</LI>
  <LI><B>Step:</B> the step number which is currently edited (1..256)<BR>
  <LI><B>G#1 Vel:127 Len: 75%:</B> informations about the MIDI event which is sent by the selected step. It differs depending on the event assigned to the step, e.g. for a chord step the name of the chord will be displayed, for a CC step you will see the CC number and value.<BR>
A new step is selected when the appr. rotary encoder is moved or by pressing the appr. GP button.</LI>
</UL></P>


<P CLASS=DESC>Alternatively, each track can get an individual name and category which are displayed at the upper display line. In this example, the name "SoloSynthline2" and the category name "Synth" has been choosen. Name/Category can be edited in the Event menu.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit2.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>

<P CLASS=DESC>The <B>lower line</B> shows the values of 16 steps within the selected track view and parameter layer. They can be directly modified with the 16 GP rotary encoders below these items. The displayed parameter of the step changes with the active layer. E.g. in layer C the gatelength is controlled, which is visualised with vertical bars:<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit3.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Length"></IMG></CENTER></P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Press&amp;hold a GP button to change into <B>EDIT RECORDING</B> mode. Incoming MIDI events will be recorded into the selected step as long as the parameter layer configuration is matching, and layers are free. E.g. it's possible to record MIDI Notes, CCs, PitchBender, Poly Pressure (Aftertouch), Program Change values. The step will be framed by curly brackets to indicate the mode:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/editrec.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Record"></IMG></CENTER></P>
<P CLASS=DESC>EDIT recording can also be toggled on/off with the SELECT button. This allows you to keep this recording mode enabled while no GP button is pressed (useful if you want to enter chords with two hands). Select the step into which the events should be recorded with the datawheel.<BR>
<I>Note1: if recording isn't working as expected, check the recording configuration by pressing EDIT+GP12. At the right side of the page the MIDI port and channel to which the recording function will listen has to be selected.</I><BR>
<I>Note2: EDIT RECORDING always behaves like a step recording (not like a live recording) regardless of the configuration in the JAM page. Live recording is only active while you are in the JAM page!</I><BR>
<I>Note3: EDIT RECORDING is the most simple way to enter chords into the parameter layers!</I><BR>

<P CLASS=DESC>Press&amp;hold the EDIT button to open a special page which allows to select different view modes:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit13.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <UL CLASS=CL>
     <LI> <B>Step View:</B> you already know it;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>Trigger View:</B> left page allows to select the step, Gate,
       Accent, Roll, Glide, Skip, Random Gate and Random Velocity.<BR>
       Right Page allows to edit up to 8 parameter layers.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit14.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>Layer View:</B> allows to select the step, Gate and up to 14
       parameter layer. Especially nice for custom chord editing.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit15.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>303 View:</B> provides a 303ish interface to select the Step,
       Gate, Accent, Glide, Octave, Note, Velocity and up to 9
       additional parameter layers
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit16.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>Step Select:</B> allows to enable/disable the steps which are controlled by the ALL function. E.g., with the pattern below, only steps 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14 (plus the edited step) will be changed if the ALL function has been activated:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit12.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Edit Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
If the track consists of more than 16 steps, the selection pattern will be applied on each step view.
     <LI> <B>Record Config:</B> enters the Recording configuration page (see detailed menu page description later in this chapter)
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/record1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Random"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>Random Generator:</B> enters the Random Generator page (see detailed menu page description later in this chapter)
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/trkrnd1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Random"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
     <LI> <B>Euclid Generator:</B> enters the Euclidean Rhythm Generator page (see detailed menu page description later in this chapter)

     </UL>
</P>



<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Gatelength </H2>
<P CLASS=DESC>The gatelength parameter needs some additional explanations, as it not only allows to set the length of a note, but also to trigger a glide (overlapping note) and to play an event multiple times.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>The Length can be adjusted from 0% to 100% in 96 steps.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit4.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit5.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>
<P CLASS=DESC>In following audio example, the gatelength of all steps is varied with a single rotary encoder - this can be achieved by pushing the ALL button: **MP3**"http://www.ucapps.de/mp3/midibox_seq/mbseqv3_gl_normal.mp3"#ffffff**</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>The next example demonstrates the usage of the glide function. The track length is reduced to 4 steps. Following notes are played with a fixed gatelength of 92%:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit6.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>
<P CLASS=DESC>Later, the length will be set to "glide" at step 2 - this note will overlap the next note at step 3 in order to trigger a Glide on synths which support "fingered portamento" or "SusKey"</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit7.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>
<P CLASS=DESC>Finally glide will also be activated on the third step:</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit8.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>
<P CLASS=DESC>It sounds like demonstated in this MP3 sample:**MP3**"http://www.ucapps.de/mp3/midibox_seq/mbseqv3_gl_glide.mp3"#ffffff** </P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Drum Edit Page</H2>

<P CLASS=DESC>If a track is configured for drum mode, the edit page changes to a special view which doesn't show the Note names anymore, but small icons instead:<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit_d1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Up to 16 drum instruments can be triggered per track. You can change to another instrument by pressing the TrgSel (F3) or TrgLayer C button:<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit_d2.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER><BR>
This page shows animated VU meters for each instrument (to give you an overview about the played instruments), and allows you to select the instrument with GP buttons.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>The name of the selected drum instrument is displayed at the right upper corner of the edit page:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/edit_d3.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Track Selection Page</H2>

<P CLASS=DESC>The track selection page shows animated VU meters for each track to give you an overview about the track activity. In addition, it allows you to select one or more tracks by using the GP buttons:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/trksel1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Parameter Selection Page</H2>

<P CLASS=DESC>By pressing the ParSel button (or ParLayer C button if the track is partitioned for more than 4 layers), the parameter selection page will be displayed which shows VU meters for each layer. By pressing a GP button a parameter layer can be selected for editing:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/parsel1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Trigger Selection Page</H2>

<P CLASS=DESC>Each track provides 8 trigger layers, which can be selected by pressing the TrgSel (F3) or Trigger Layer C button:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/trgsel1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Step Selection Page</H2>

<P CLASS=DESC>The StepView (F2) Button changes to a zoomed view of the edit page to give you a nice overview (if the track is configured for more than 64 steps, the dots for each step will be smaller). Use the GP buttons to change to another step view:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/stepsel1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT=""></IMG></CENTER></P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Track Event Configuration (Shortcut: MENU+GP Button #2)</H2>
<P CLASS=INFO>Allows you to change the basic track setup: the type of MIDI events which should be sent by the track to a specific MIDI Channel and MIDI Port.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/trkevent1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Track Event"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Track Type (Partitioning): </B> each track has a step memory of 1024 bytes, and a trigger memory of 2048 bits. There are predefined modes which simplify the partitioning of the available memory to free assignable parameter and trigger layers.</P>

</TABLE>
</LI>
<LI>Parameter layers can be assigned to following functions:
  <UL CLASS=CL>
    <LI><B>None:</B> the parameter layer has no function.
    <LI><B>Note:</B> controls the key and octave of a step. Notes can be assigned to multiple layers for polyphonic playing.
    <LI><B>Chord:</B> a chord is generated instead of a single note. 32 chords are predefined and can be transposed by +/- 2 octaves. All notes are aligned to C scale, the track transpose function has to be used to play different scales.
      <UL CLASS=CL>
        <LI><B>A-C:</B> Major I, Major II, Major III (transposed variants)</LI>
        <LI><B>D-F:</B> Root note, 3rd note, 5th note (single notes)</LI>

        <LI><B>i-n:</B> Min6, Min7, Min8, Min9, Min10, Min12 (4-note chords)</LI>
        <LI><B>o-p:</B> Co7 and Min+</LI>
      </UL></LI>
    <LI><B>Chord2:</B> enhanced chords</LI>
    <LI><B>Chord3:</B> our secrent weapon with >100 chords provided by EsotericLabs! **MP3**"http://www.ucapps.de/mp3/midibox_seq/20170623.mp3"#ffffff**</LI>
    <LI><B>Velolcity:</B> controls the velocity value for all notes/chords of the instrument.
    <LI><B>Length:</B> controls the gatelength of all notes of the instrument
    <LI><B>CC:</B> plays a selectable CC number.<BR>
           CC#128 (displayed as "off") is initialized by default for each layers. With this CC assignment, no events will be sent, which means in other words, that a valid CC number has to be selected with one of the GP encoders 11..13 to send something. Note also, that after the CC has been selected, one of the GP buttons 11..13 has to be pressed to confirm the CC number change. This handling ensures, that no unintended CCs will be sent while the CC number is changed.
    <LI><B>PrgCh:</B> sends a program change event.
    <LI><B>Pitch:</B> sends a PitchWheel event
    <LI><B>Prob:</B> sets the probability that the step will be played (1..100%)
    <LI><B>Delay:</B> delays the step for 1..96 microticks
    <LI><B>Roll:</B> also known as "ratcheting", plays the step 2..5 times with ascenting/descenting velocity (intensity: 0..15). 127 variations are available - great for drum patterns!<BR>
The distance between the repeats is predefined to: 48 ticks on 2 repeats, 32 ticks on 3 repeats, 36 ticks on 4 repeats, 32 ticks on 5 repeats.
    <LI><B>Roll2:</B> plays the step 2..5 times. Instead of velocity the distance between the steps can be directly controlled.<BR>
The first number means, how often the event will be played (2, 3, 4 or 5 times), the second number specifies the number of clock ticks between the events (accuracy depends on number of repeats). Examples:</P>
<P CLASS=DESC><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/tutorial4/gatelength_v4_2x48.gif" width=200 height=109 ALT="" align="left">One step consists of 96 clock ticks. With the 2x48 setting the note will be played at the beginning and in the middle of the step. </IMG></P>
<BR><BR><BR>
<P CLASS=DESC><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/tutorial4/gatelength_v4_3x63.gif" width=200 height=109 ALT="" align="left">With 3x63, the note will be played three times with a distance of 63 clock steps - at 0, 63 and 126. A delay of 126 crosses the step range of 96, so that the last note slips into the range of the second step. This sometimes results into nice, unexpected grooves! :-)</P>
<P CLASS=DESC>In following example, various roll2 parameters are used for the snare drum. Here a screenshot of the 32 step sequence (which is played 2 times):

    <LI><B>Nth1 and Nth2:</B> this powerful feature has been suggested by <A HREF="http://midibox.org/forums/topic/13137-midibox-seq-v4-release-feedback/?p=169722" TARGET="_blank">Pawaga</A> in the MIDIbox forum, it allows to create long variant patterns which change based on mathematical rules.<BR>
    A special action will be triggered on each nth bar (Nth1) starting at the 1st bar, or after nth bars (Nth2).<BR>
    For example for a 4 step sequence "CGDF" with Nth1 values "Pl1, Pl3, Mu3, Pl4" would result into:

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> IIC Ports</H2>

<P CLASS=INFO>The <A HREF="mbhp_iic_midi.html">MBHP_IIC_MIDI</A> module allows you to add 4 additional, independent (!) MIDI outputs. Main advantage of multiple MIDI ports is reduced latency (as MIDI events can be sent in parallel), and relaxed MIDI channel handling (for 4 synths you don't need to take care about the MIDI channel at all)</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Bus1..4: the Loopback Ports</H2>

<P CLASS=INFO>A loopback port forwards Note and CC events to the MIDI handler of the sequencer itself. This opens a wide range of possibilities, especially for experimental, non-static, self-changing sequences. Classical usecase is a setup of self-modifiying and loopbacked tracks which play completely autarkic for several minutes without an interaction from your side.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>When a track sends MIDI notes, it can control the transposer and arpeggiator w/o an external keyboard. For the transposer a single note should be sent, for the arpeggiator either four notes (from different parameter layers) or Chords (from a single parameter layer).</BR>

<P CLASS=INFO>Loopbacks can be send to four busses. Each track provides the possibility to select the Bus to that the Transposer/Arpeggiator should listen. This allows to transpose tracks individually. The MIDI channel to which a note is sent doesn't matter.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>A CC loopback allows to control sequencer parameters which are listed in <A HREF="midibox_seq/mbseqv4_cc_implementation.txt">the CC implementation chart</A>. In difference to Note events, the MIDI channel gets an important purpose here, as it selects the target track of which the parameters should be modified. The CC# corresponds with the NRPN LSB number.<BR>
Example: Loopback Channel #3, CC#49 controls the Octave Transpose of Track 3</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>CC#1 has a special purpose, as it allows to control the Morphing parameter, which works track independent. Accordingly, Morphing can be controlled from any selected MIDI channel</P>


<P CLASS=DESC><I>Hot tip (1): put the loopback tracks into a separate pattern. This allows you to play different chord lines from a "master pattern" without changing the "slave patterns".</I></P>
<P CLASS=DESC><I>Hot tip (2): clock a loopback track with unqueal divider values, this can lead to surprising results!</I></P>

<P CLASS=DESC>In following MP3 sample a loopback track transposes a second track which plays a bass line: **MP3**"http://www.ucapps.de/mp3/midibox_seq/mbseqv3_loopback.mp3"#ffffff**<BR>
From 0:00-0:07 the bassline is played w/ the base note C-3, from 0:00-0:23 the bassline is sometimes transposed by one octave (C-4) (Track Mode->Transpose activated). The loopback track is clocked at 384ppqn/4*16 (4th notes)<BR>
From 0:24 I selected an alternative pattern which sends various notes to the loopback port at a clock rate of 384ppqn/4*13 - the result sounds like a live jam on the keyboard, but it was more or less a random effect initiated by the asynchronously clocked loopback track. :)</P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> CV Port (also known as "AOUT Port")</H2>

<P CLASS=INFO>The CV1..4 Port allows you to control the analog outputs of up to 4 chained <A HREF="mbhp_aout.html">MBHP_AOUT</A>, <A HREF="mbhp_aout_lc.html">MBHP_AOUT_LC</A> or <A HREF="http://www.midibox.org/dokuwiki/aout_ng">MBHP_AOUT_NG</A> modules. 8 gate triggers are available at port J5A/J5B of the core module (enabled by default in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file) or (preferred) at DOUT shift registers which is configured in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file (search for CV_GATE_SR1) - this way you get access to all 32 gates if 4 DOUT SRs are used.</P>

Audio Example: **MP3**"http://www.ucapps.de/mp3/midibox_seq/mbseqv3_arp.mp3"#ffffff**<BR>
You cannot imagine how easy it is to setup complex arpeggiator textures when you never tried this by yourself :) - the <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtnUMpykQLc" TARGET="_blank">Session #4 video</A> gives a nice example of some arpeggios which where created within a few number of minutes<BR>
When you turn the rotary encoder within the Edit Page to select the "Arp Event" for a step, you may notice events with the format "x*y".<BR>
These are Multi-Arp events. They play the appr. step so many times as notes are held on the external keyboard. Each key will be 
transposed by the specified octave value (-3..+3). Once all keys have been played, the sequencer continues with the next step of the track.<BR>
This feature has been explained in <A HREF="midibox_seq_tutorial4.html">Tutorial #4</A> for MBSEQ V2, and it is still available in MBSEQ V4<BR>

  <LI><B>Bus:</B> selects Bus1..Bus4 over which the Transposer/Arpeggiator should be controlled. Each bus provides a separate MIDI port/channel/keyboard zone that can be configured in the MIDI page. Alternatively busses can transfer the output of loopback tracks as described earlier.<BR>
     Since each track has an own bus assignment, it's possible to transpose tracks individually.</LI>
  <LI><B>Note:</B> Allows to specify, if the transposer should take the last or first played note</LI>
  <LI><B>Hold:</B> the last or first key or chord is held until a new key/chord is played on the keyboard (only relevant for Tranpose/Arpeggiator mode)</LI>
  <LI><B>Sort:</B> only relevant for arpeggiator mode: the note stack will be sorted when this function is active (default); arpeggios will be played with notes "as played" when this functions is deactivated.</LI>
  <LI><B>ReSt. (Restart):</B> the track is restarted when a new key/chord is played</LI>
  <LI><B>STrg. (Step Trigger):</B> if activated, the step progression will be controlled from the transposer
     bus, hence it can either be triggered from a loopback track or from an external MIDI device (MIDI keyboard, sequencer, etc.)<BR>
     Note that each track can be assigned to a dedicated transpose bus (4 busses are available), this allows to control 4 independent step progressions for all 16 tracks.</LI>
  <LI><B>FTS (Force to Scale):</B> played notes are mapped to the global scale, which can be selected in the Fx-Scale menu page, accordingly only notes are played which match with the selected harmony.

The "Replay" parameter allows to repeat a portion of steps the given number of times.<BR>

  <LI><B>Repeat/Skip/Interval Progression Parameters:</B> have been introduced in MIDIbox SEQ V4 to simplify the creation of "Berlin School"
patterns (as known from artists like Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, ...) - the Iteration parameter defines a range at 
which a step will be repeated several times, or several steps will be skipped.<BR>
For example: "Itv.:4, Repeat:2, Skip:0" will play the steps in following order: 1-2-3-4-4-4-5-6-7-8-8-8-9-10-11-12-12-12-..<BR>
Another example: "Itv.:4, Repeat:0, Skip:1" will play the steps in following order: 1-2-3-4-6-7-8-9-10-12-13-14-15-2-3-4-5-7-8-9-10-..<BR>
Very interesting results can be achieved in conjunction with the groove function when it controls the velocity at a different interval. Also a second track which controls CC parameters with different track progression can lead to nice variations!<BR>
Examples: A simple 4-step sequence is played, and the tone colour is varied from a separate 16-step CC track:<BR>

  <LI><B>Clock Divider:</B> MBSEQ V4 works at a resolution of up to 384 ppqn, which is 16 times faster the MIDI clock standard of 24 ppqn. The divider allows you to clock the track with a fraction of the MIDI clock.<BR>
A divider value of 4 clocks the track with normal resolution, accordingly each step plays a 16th note, and the gatelength can be varied between 1..96 steps!<BR>
A divider value of 2 clocks the track two times faster, accordingly each step plays a 32th note, the gatelength can be varied between 1..48 steps.<BR>
With a divider value of 64, each step will play a whole note (extremely slow, especially useful for strings/pads)</LI>
  <LI><B>Normal/Triplet:</B> with the "normal" setting, the 384ppqn clock will be pre-divided by 24, whereas with "triple" it will be pre-divided by 16. This results into a triplet timebase, where (for example) 24 steps instead of 16 are played per measure during the same time period. The track length has to be adapted accordingly, or "Synch to measure" should be activated to ensure that the track is in synch with tracks which are played at a "normal" timebase.<BR>
Example for a track clocked at a triplet timebase 16T. A bassline with "normal" timebase 16 is added at 0:03, a drumline at 0:07:<BR>

The sequencer will transmit MIDI Clock/Start/Stop/Continue events to the MIDI Out ports for synchronising with external gear (this has to be enabled for each port separately in the MIDI config page)</LI>
      <LI>In <B>slave</B> mode, the sequencer will be controlled by incoming MIDI Clock/Start/Stop/Continue events for synchronisation with an external MIDI clock master. Note that the sequencer will halt as long as no MIDI clock is received in this mode!</LI>
      <LI>In <B>auto</B> mode, the sequencer will automatically switch between master and slave mode. This is the most comfortable setting, and therefore enabled by default.<BR>
          Slave mode is selected once a MIDI Clock/Start/Stop/Continue event has been received.<BR>

<P CLASS=INFO><B>Section Control:</B></P>
<P CLASS=INFO>It's possible to select sections of a track that should be played from a MIDI keyboard as demonstrated in following video:
<center>

Key C..B select section 1..12, the first key of the octave (C) plays the first section as usual, it has the same effect as if this feature is disabled.<BR>
The width of a section depends on the track length.<BR>
E.g., if the track length is set to 32, and if it consists of 256 steps, 8 sections are available which can be selected with Key C/C#/D/D#/E/F#/F/F#/G<BR>
It is recommended to activate the "Follow" function under UTILITY-&gt;OPTIONS when using this feature, so that the edit display gets automatically updated whenever the section is changed.</P>

<P CLASS=INFO><B>MIDI Router:</B>
<P CLASS=INFO>Provides a simple possibility to route incoming MIDI events to synthesizers which are connected to the MIDI Out ports (which means: also to the CV port - MBSEQ replaces a CV interface!)
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/midi3.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="MIDI Cfg"></CENTER></IMG>
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Node:</B> 8 routing pathes are available<BR>

  <LI><B>Source Channel:</B> either a dedicated source channel (1-16) or "all" channels can be selected</LI>
  <LI><B>OUT:</B> selects the MIDI output port</LI>
  <LI><B>Target Channel:</B> either a dedicated target channel (1-16) or "all" channels can be selected.<BR>
     Alternatively, also "Track" can be selected as target channel. In this case, incoming MIDI events will be routed to the MIDI port and channel of a track depending on the incoming MIDI channel number.<BR>
     Usecase: MIDI events, such as CC or Notes, should be sent from a master keyboard
     or MIDI controller to synths which are assigned to different port and MIDI channels
     in the track configuration.<BR>
     Just select the track with the MIDI channel on your keyboard/controller, the router
     will take care that the events reach the right destination.<BR>
     Another alternative option is "SelTrk" - MIDI events are sent from a master keyboard or MIDI controller to the MIDI port and channel of the currently selected track.

Some of these functions can also be assigned to a Program Change Event.<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/midi7.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="MIDI Cfg"></CENTER></IMG>

The MIDI ports and channel over which these functions are accessible is free assignable. An IN port can be specified for receiving the events (e.g. functions should be controlled from an external DAW), and an OUT port for sending the events (e.g. changes made interactively on the control panel should be recorded with an external DAW).<BR>
The MIDI channel is disabled by default, which means that the Ext Ctrl. feature has to be explicitly enabled in the MIDI-&gtExt Ctrl. page!!<BR>
Following functions can be assigned:
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Morph Value:</B> controls the morph function for all tracks.
  <LI><B>Scale:</B> allows to change the scale for the force-to-scale function.
  <LI><B>Song Number:</B> selects a song
  <LI><B>Song Phrase:</B> selects a phrase in the current song
  <LI><B>Mixer Map:</B> selects and dump a mixer map
  <LI><B>Pattern G1..G4:</B> selects a pattern for Group 1..4 (4 different CCs have to be specified)
  <LI><B>Bank G1..G4:</B> selects a bank for Group 1..4 (4 different CCs have to be specified, however it's recommended to leave the banks untouched, which means: G1 should always use Bank 1, G2 should use Bank 2, G3 Bank 3, G4 Bank 4)
  <LI><B>All Notes Off:</B> empties all note stack (transposer, arpeggiator, AOUT)
  <LI><B>NRPNs:</B> sequencer parameters can be accessed via NRPNs, see also <A HREF="https://github.com/midibox/mios32/blob/master/apps/sequencers/midibox_seq_v4/doc/mbseqv4_cc_implementation.txt" TARGET="_blank">mbseqv4_cc_implementation.txt</A>. This option allows to enable/disable this function.
  <LI><B>Program Change Mode:</B> specifies what a Program Change event should change: off/Patterns/Song/Phrase
  <LI><B>Mutes (first CC):</B> the 16 track mutes can be controlled via CCs as well. With this option you specify the first CC which should be taken. E.g. with CC16, the Mute of Track1 will be turned on/off with CC#16, Track2 with CC#17, Track3 with CC#18, ... Track16 with CC#31

    By pressing the SELECT button, filters for MIDI Clock (F8) and Active Sense (FE) events can be enabled/disabled.<BR>
    Both filters are activated by default. Once the clock filter is deactivated, the OUT/IN items will (probably) show CLK permanently as long as a MIDI clock is received/sent over the appr. port. This allows you to analyze the MIDI Clock In/Out settings as configured in the BPM page.
    Once the Active Sense filter is deactivated, FE events will be displayed periodically on the appr. IN port if a connected MIDI keyboard sends such events.

<P CLASS=DESC>Following functions can be controlled from the "Jam cockpit":
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Step Recording</B> allows to input notes and CCs stepwise, the cursor will jump to the next position after a new note/CC has been received and stored into the step.
  <LI><B>Realtime (Live) Recording</B> supports monophonic note, polyphonic chords (chord 1/2 and note/note/note layer mode), and CC events, which are stored into the currently selected track while the sequencer is playing.</B> 
  <LI><B>Live Pattern Recording</B> can be used to play and record customizable arpeggiator sequences.
  <LI><B>Live Forwarding</B> forwards incoming MIDI events (e.g. from a MIDI keyboard) to the MIDI port/channel which is configured for the currently selected track. Octave Transpose, MIDI effects (such as Echo, Humanizer, Limits) such as Force-to-Scale can be optionally applied.
</UL>

<P CLASS=DESC>In distance to certain other sequencers, it is not required to stop an ongoing sequence to start recording!<BR>
Incoming events will be immediately inserted into the selected track. If the current step already holds a note/CC, it will be replaced by the new one. The gatelength of a note will be recorded as well, it can allocate multiple steps. If a new note is played over such a "stretched" step, the previous note will be automatically split.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Incoming CC events will be automatically assigned to free CC layers so that no pre-configuration is required. A CC layer is "free" (unassigned) as long as the CC number is turned "off".

<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Copy:</B> transfers the currently selected track into the copy buffer.<BR>
    If you press and hold the button below the COPY item, you can select the range which should be copied into the buffer with the GP encoders.<BR>
    The encoders left of or at the begin marker shift the begin position, the encoders right to the begin marker shift the end position.<BR>
    If you are unsure about the current position, just always use the leftmost encoder to move the begin marker, and the rightmost encoder to move the end marker.<BR>
    Releasing the copy button copies the selected range into the buffer. If the button is just pressed and depressed, the whole range will be copied.</LI>
  <LI><B>Paste:</B> transfers the copy buffer content into the track.<BR>
      Either the parameter/trigger layers, or the whole track will be copied. The behaviour of this function can be configured in the UTIL->OPT page<BR>
    As long as the button below PASTE is pushed, you can specify the target position with a GP rotary encoder.<BR>
    <I>Hot tip: This is the quickest solution to duplicate parts of a track!</I></LI>
  <LI><B>Clr:</B> clears the parameter/trigger layers, or the whole track. The behaviour of this function can be configured in the UTIL->OPT page</LI>
  <LI><B>Move:</B> as long as the appr. button of this function is pushed, the edit page will be displayed, and steps can be moved with the encoder below the step.<BR>
    It should be self explaining once you try it out! :)</LI>
  <LI><B>Scroll:</B> as long as the button of this function is pushed, the steps of the current track can be scrolled with the rotary encoders. The start position of the scrolling function depends on the used rotary encoder. E.g., if the first GP encoder is used, the whole track will be scrolled, if the 9th rotary encoder is used, the 9th and all steps behind will be scrolled, and step 1-8 will be left untouched.</LI>
  <LI><B>Random:</B> shortcut to the Random Generator (see below)</LI>

<P CLASS=INFO>In distance to common solutions which you can find around the web, the MBSEQ based generator writes static sequences into the track storage so that they can also be modified if desired! There are separate views for Drum and "Normal" tracks - for Drum tracks individual sequences can be generated for each instrument, while in a normal track the gates are only generated for a single instrument.<BR>
Another difference to common solutions is the random accent generator which adds some more variety to each step.</P>

<P CLASS=INFO>This page has an unusual layout and handling! It is intended for special customizations for which no other place have been found, or which need extended descriptions (whenever a short item name wouldn't describe the parameter sufficiently).</P>
<P CLASS=INFO>The various parameters have to be selected with one of encoders GP1..8 (left page), and the parameter value has to be selected with one of the encoders GP9..16 (right page).</P>

<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Track Synchronisation - Steps per Measure</B>: the length of a measure is 16 16th note steps by default, it can be set from 1..256 steps.<BR>
This setting affects:
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI>the synch-to-measure function for clock divider reset</LI>
  <LI>the metronome ("Meas.Note" played after x steps)</LI>
  <LI>the song position displayed at song page (shows reference step position)</LI>
</UL>
Note: for max. steps != track length it makes sense to activate the synch-to-measure 
function for each track (-> divider page), so that the tracks are always in synch 
with the reference step position. It can be left deactivated if it is your intention 
 to clock tracks asynchronously to the reference position.</LI>

  <LI><B>Pattern Change Synchronisation - Change considered each x steps</B>: defines the number of steps per pattern. This setting affects:
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI>the synch-to-measure function for pattern changes (pattern change after X steps)</LI>
  <LI>the loop incrementer in song mode</LI>
</UL>

  <LI><B>Pattern Change Synchronisation:</B> if enabled, a pattern change made in the PATTERN or SONG page (Phrase mode) won't take place immediately, but will be synchronized to the pattern length of X steps as defined in the previous option page.</LI>

  <LI><B>Pattern Change re-sends Program Change:</B> enable this option if a Program Change MIDI message should be re-sent whenever a pattern is changed (you might want to use it to re-initialize synth patches).</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Restart all Tracks on Pattern Change (RATOPC):</B> added due to requests from multiple users: all tracks will be restarted whenever a new pattern is selected. If SyncChange enabled, this means that all tracks will synchronize correctly independent from their track length, if SyncChange disabled, this means that you can do nice breaks while changing patterns (try it! ;-)</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Dump a predefined Mixer Map on Pattern Changes:</B> whenever a pattern is changed, a corresponding mixer map will be dumped. The Mixer map number is predefined: A1 uses Mixer Map #1, A2 uses Mixer Map #2, etc...</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Synchronize MUTE to Measure:</B> if enabled, mutes set in the Mute page will be synched to the selected steps per measure. This feature is inspired from the "MIDI Clip Launcher" of Ableton Live.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Synchronize UNMUTE to Measure:</B> the same for Unmute (behaviour can be selected separately).</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Unmute Tracks on Pattern Change:</B> some users requested this.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Auto-Select unmuted Track:</B> nobody requested this, but I find it useful :-)</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Paste and Clear Button will modify</B> allows you to change the behaviour of the Paste and Clear function:
    <UL CLASS=CL>
      <LI><B>Only Steps:</B> only parameter and trigger layers will be cleared/pasted (default)</LI>
      <LI><B>Complete Track:</B> the whole track configuration will be cleared/pasted. Only exception: MIDI channel and MIDI port will never be overwritten.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  
  <LI><B>Selection restored on Track Change:</B> if enabled, each track will have its individual instrument, parameter/trigger layer and step view selections</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Allow to change Pattern Banks:</B> by default, track groups 1/2/3/4 are assigned to bank 1/2/3/4. Actually it could confuse users if banks are changed, therefore it's possible to hide the bank selection, so that it can't be changed.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>ALL Function works on Step View only:</B> the edit page has multiple views, the default one is called "step view". In other pages the ALL function (which changes all values based on the encoder entry of the currently edited step) might confuse users, therefore it can be disabled there.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Print/Modify Steps w/o changing Gates:</B> by default, a gate is activated whenever a note value is changed. If the user desires to change note values without playing them by default (gate stays inactive), this option should be enabled. In this case, the gate always has to be enabled manually to play a note!</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Print Notes with Transposed Values:</B> if enabled, the Note values of a track will be print according to the current transpose.</LI>

  <LI><B>Metronome:</B> configures the Metronome function:

         <LI><B>Channel:</B> the channel to which the metronome will send</LI>
         <LI><B>Measure Note:</B> note which will be send on each measure</LI>
         <LI><B>Beat Note:</B> note which will be send on each beat</LI>
       </UL>
    </LI>

  <LI><B>Shadow Out</B>: this option allows you to send all outgoing MIDI messages to a second output port. This might be useful in conjunction with controllers allow to display played notes.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Frontpanel MIDI Remote Control</B> via a configurable key. If the key is pressed, frontpanel functions can be emulated with additional keys as documented <A HREF="midibox_seq/mbseq_remote_functions.pdf">here</A></LI>
  
  <LI><B>Sending selected Track as CC to a DAW:</B> allows to send a CC message whenever a track is changed. Useful to synchronize a DAW with the frontpanel selection.</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Runtime Status Optimization:</B> for MIDI OUT ports is enabled by default, which saves some bandwidth. If your MIDI device doesn't handle it correctly, disable this feature (can be done for each individual OUT port).</LI>
  
  <LI><B>Initial CC value for Clear and Init is: X</B>: allows to specify the default value which will be used for CCs whenever the Clear button is pressed, or the Init function in the MENU-&gt;EVENT page is used. It's normally 64, but some people prefer 0 instead. Just define it here.</LI>

  <LI><B>If Live function, matching received MIDI events will ...</B>: this experimental function works in conjunction with Live mode or the MIDI Router in "Track" or "Sel.Trk" mode.<BR>
    Whenever Note, CC, PitchBender, Poly Pressure (Aftertouch), Program Change events are received on the selected IN Port, the corresponding track layer (or LFO CC) will be muted completely, or temporary for a given number of steps. This allows to temporary overrule events generated by the sequencer from an external MIDI keyboard or controller.<BR>
    Supported settings:
    <UL CLASS=CL>
       <LI><B>do nothing</B>: function disabled
       <LI><B>mute the appr. layer</B>: once a matching events has been received, the corresponding track layers will be muted, and have to be unmuted in the MUTE page
       <LI><B>mute layer for X steps</B>: allows to temporary mute the layer for a given number of steps

<P CLASS=DESC>The ALL and FAST button are working as well. The ALL button provides the two known functions (values set to same value while button pushed, relative changes as long as LED active). The FAST function will be deactivated/activated automatically depending on the value range.</P>
<P CLASS=DESC>If a GP button of a mixer channel is pressed, all events of this channel will be dumped.
<P CLASS=DESC>Values are sent directly over the selected MIDI port - all ports are selectable, even Loopback and AOUT!</P>

</UL></P>

<P CLASS=DESC><I>Hot tip: since the ports and channels are freely assignable and working totally independent from the selected sequencer patterns, the mixer map function behaves like a MIDI controller - you can define up to 127 maps which can be stored, restore, dumped and controlled in realtime!<BR>In song mode it is possible to dump one or more mixer maps before switching to a new pattern set.</I></P>


<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Mute Page </H2>
<P CLASS=DESC>Within the mute page you can quickly mute/unmute tracks with the 16 GP buttons:<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/mute1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Mute Page"></IMG></CENTER><BR>
Each track has an animated VU meter to display the MIDI activity.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>In addition, it's possible to mute individual parameter layers or drum instruments of a track by pressing&holding the Mute button:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/mute2.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Mute Page"></IMG></CENTER></P>

<P CLASS=DESC><I>Hot tip: nice breaks can be realized by activating SOLO and selecting multiple tracks - one after another - while the sequencer is playing.

<P CLASS=DESC>By pressing the ALL button in this page, some special shortcuts are available:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/mute3.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Mute Page"></IMG></CENTER></P>
This page allows you to Mute or Unmute all tracks, all layers of the selected track, or all tracks and layers with a single push on the button.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>It's possible to synchronize Mutes and Unmutes to a selectable measure of 1..256 steps. This feature is inspired from the "MIDI Clip Launcher" of Ableton Live and can be enabled in the Utility-&gt;Options page! Whenever a GP button is pressed, the Mute won't take place immediately, but synchronized to the measure. A countdown will be displayed under the track name to inform you about an ongoing mute/unmute.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>With synchronisation enabled, it's sometimes preferable to bypass this option for an immediate mute/unmute. This can be achieved by activating the FAST button function.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>For a fast usage the Track and Layer buttons have a special function in this page: the Track buttons select the pattern group G1..G4, Layer button A sets the cursor to the "Song" item, Layer button B selects the "Position" item, Layer button C selects the "Action" item.</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Song mode is demonstrated in the <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyffClGnFN4" TARGET="_blank">Session #2 video</A></P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Back to Phrase Mode: select the "Position" item by pushing Parameter Layer button B. By pushing a GP button, the sequencer will execute the action defined at song position A1, B1, C1..P1 (16 possible actions). If a pattern set or mixer map is defined at this song position, the sequencer will change to it and continue as normal - since we are not in song mode, the next song positions won't be processed.</P>
<P CLASS=DESC>Phrases can also be combined with one or more mixer maps. In this case the first step (A1, B1, C1, ...) has to be assigned to a Mixer Map Action, whose content will be dumped out. The sequencer will go to the next song position, and check for a Mixer Map again. Once it has reached a position with a pattern set, it will change to the new set and give back control over pattern changes to the user.</P>
<P CLASS=DESC>On the same way it's possible to control Mutes and tempo.</P>

    <CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/disk_se1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Disk"></CENTER></IMG><BR>
  </LI>
  <LI><B>MIDI File Import:</B> allows to import MIDI files, stored in the midi/ directory of your SD Card.<BR>
    <CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/disk_i1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Disk"></CENTER></IMG><BR>
    All tracks are imported at once (up to 16) in the same order they are stored in the .mid file. Accordingly, track assignments can be done within the .mid file before it is imported (e.g. edit the .mid file with your DAW)<BR>
    Currently only MIDI Notes and drums are supported (no CCs, no Pitchbender).<BR>
    To import drum tracks, change the import mode from "Note" to "Drum". This mode especially allows to control the velocity of each step separately.<BR>
    Currently drum instruments are only mapped to a pre-selection of 4/8/16 notes - this map cannot be customized yet!<BR>
    Since MIDIbox SEQ is a step sequencer, notes will be quantised with a selectable resolution (16th, 32th or 64th).<BR>
    Also the number of layers/drum instruments is selectable (4, 8 or 16). <BR>
    Than more layers are available, than more notes can be played at the same step. In "Note" mode, all notes share the same velocity and length value, in "Drum" mode each step and instrument has a dedicated velocity value.<BR>
    If the imported track contains different velocity or length values for polyphonic played notes, and this characteristic is important, it is recommended to split the track into multiple pieces (e.g. for long and for short notes) and to import them into separate MBSEQ tracks.<BR>
    Another hint: if notes of the imported track don't start exactly at the 16th/32th/64th note position (e.g. because they have a "swing" feel), it is recommended to quantize the notes in a DAW before the import.<BR>
    The swing feel can be added again after the import (GROOVE page).<BR>
    All tracks will be initialized depending on the selected resolution and layers before the import is started. Than higher the resolution, or than more layers are selected, than less bars can be imported (number of bars is displayed on page).<BR>
    The MIDI port will always be set to DEFAULT during import. The MIDI channel will be set to the channel of the first played note (for each track separately).<BR>
    MIDI Files can be imported while the sequencer is running. This allows you to search for a certain file, but also to try different parameters during runtime.<BR>
    Here two MP3 examples of patterns that have been imported, and that are played by MBSEQ (and not by a MIDI player...).<BR>

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Fx Scale</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/fx_scale.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Fx Scale"></CENTER></IMG>

<P CLASS=INFO>This page allows to configure the scale which should be used by the Force-to-Scale function:<BR>
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>Control:</B> the scale and root note can either be controlled globally or pattern based. In distance to the global scale/root (which is stored in the global configuration of a session), the pattern based scale/root is located within the G1/G2/G3 or G4 pattern and will be automatically changed when a new pattern is selected.<BR>
Only one group can control the scale and root note - it can be selected with this menu item.</LI>
  <LI><B>Root:</B> selects the root note (C, C#, D, D#, ..., B) of the scale. Optionally the root note can be directly controlled from a MIDI keyboard. In this case it is the base note which is also forwarded to the transposer. KEYB is the default setting.</LI>
  <LI><B>Selected Scale:</B> allows you to select one of 166 (!!!) scales, which are used by all tracks with enabled "force scale" option.<BR>Scales are counted from zero so that the numbers are matching with the CC#3 value.<BR> Thanks to Stryd One for providing all the scale definitions! :-)</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS=INFO>Sidenote reg. the global scale: when "Global" control mode is selected, the scale can also be changed from an external MIDI device via CC#3, and especially via internal loopback. This means, that a track can change the scale dynamically if it outputs CC#3s to the Loopback port.</P>



<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> CV Configuration Page</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/cv1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="CV"></CENTER></IMG>

<P CLASS=INFO>This page allows to select the AOUT/AOUT_LC/AOUT_NG interface, to configure CV channel and gate parameters, and to configure the DIN Sync Clock output.<BR>

<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>CV:</B> selects the CV channel (1..8, resp on MBSEQV4+ 1..32)
  <LI><B>Curve:</B> selects the output curve: V/Oct, Hz/V, Inverted
  <LI><B>SlewR(ate):</B> allows to configure a slew rate (slack) in the range of 0..255 mS
  <LI><B>SusK:</B> activates the "SusKey" function (also known as "fingered portamento"): the slew rate will only be activated if at least two notes are played. This allows to use the glide function to enable slew only on demand.
  <LI><B>PRng:</B> sets the pitch range for pitch bender events (normally 2, use 12 or 24 to sweep over one, resp. two octaves)
  <LI><B>Gate:</B> sets the gate polarity (positive or negative)
  <LI><B>Calibr.:</B> allows to force different output voltages for calibration (Min/Middle/Max/1V, 2V, 4V, 8V)<BR>
    With MBSEQV4+ additional calibration points are available which can be adjusted via SW - this allows you to compensate non-linearities of the DACs<BR>
    Note also: by pressing the GP7 button, the display will switch between unipolar (0..10V) and bilolar (-5V..5V) values - use the display mode which is matching with your HW setup.
  <LI><B>Clk:</B> selects 1 of 8 clock outputs (available at a dedicated DOUT shift registered which has been configured with the CLK_SR parameter in the MBSEQ_HW.V4 file). Each clock has an individual clock divider, or can optionally be used to output a Start/Stop signal
  <LI><B>Rate:</B> defines the output rate of the selected clock output (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 96, 192, 384 ppqn and Start/Stop)</LI>
  <LI><B>Width:</B> sets the pulsewidth of the clock output signal (1..255 mS)</LI>
  <LI><B>Module:</B> selects the AOUT module which is connected to J19 of the core module (AOUT, AOUT_LC or AOUT_NG)</LI>

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Ethernet (OSC) Page</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/eth1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT="Ethernet"></CENTER></IMG>

<P CLASS=INFO>This page allows to configure the IP settings of the MBHP_ETH interface, and the remote settings of the OSC server.<BR>

<P CLASS=INFO>Background informations about the OSC integration into MIDIbox applications can be found at <A HREF="midibox_osc.html">this page</A>.

<P CLASS=INFO>All changes won't take effect immediately, but have to be confirmed by pressing one of the "Enter" soft-buttons (GP8 and GP16)! They will be stored in the global configuration file /MBSEQ_GC.V4 on SD Card.</P>

<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI><B>DHCP:</B> if enabled, the remote IP, network mask and gateway will be requested from a DHCP server in the network. If disabled, these settings can be entered manually
  <LI><B>Ethernet Configuration Parameters:</B>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Local IP:</B> (only if DHCP not enabled): sets the IP of MIDIbox SEQ and should be unique in the network
      <LI><B>Netmask:</B> (only if DHCP not enabled): sets the netmask of your LAN
      <LI><B>Gateway:</B> (only if DHCP not enabled): sets the gateway IP (default router)
    </UL>
  <LI><B>OSC Configuration Parameters:</B>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>OSC Port:</B> 4 ports are available (OSC1..OSC4), each one can be configured with a different IP and port settings.
      <LI><B>Remote IP:</B> sets the IP of the host to which OSC packets should be sent/received
      <LI><B>Remote Port:</B> sets the port number to which OSC packets will be sent
      <LI><B>Local Port:</B> sets the port number over which OSC packets will be received

<H2> <IMG SRC="images/bullet.gif" ALT=""> Bookmark Page</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="midibox_seq/cs4/bm1.gif" width=481 height=19 ALT"Bookmarks"></CENTER></IMG>

<P CLASS=DESC>Ok, now you've probably walked through so many pages, how to remember the most favourite ones?<BR>
Use Bookmarks!<BR>
The bookmark pages is entered by pressing MENU+SELECT, or a dedicated button which is assigned in your MBSEQ_HW.V4 file (e.g. the hwcfg/wilba/MBSEQ_HW.V4 file presets this functions to the F1 button)</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>Inside this menu, press a GP button (shortly) to recall a bookmark, press&hold a GP button for 3 seconds to store a bookmark</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>The bookmark function stores following UI settings:
<UL CLASS=CL>
  <LI> Bookmark name
  <LI> Current page
  <LI> Group
  <LI> Tracks
  <LI> Mutes
  <LI> Parameter Layer
  <LI> Trigger Layer
  <LI> Instrument
  <LI> Step View
  <LI> Step
  <LI> Edit View
  <LI> Solo/All/Fast/Metronome/Loop/Follow button mode
</UL>

<P CLASS=DESC>The first 8 "global" Bookmarks are stored into the MBSEQ_BM.V4 file of the root directory, the remaining bookmarks are stored into the MBSEQ_BM.V4 file of the session directory. Both files can be edited with a common text editor.<BR>
This is the only way to change a bookmark name (5 characters)</P>

<P CLASS=DESC>It's possible to prevent, that a certain UI parameter will be overwritten by a bookmark. This can (only) be done by editing the MBSEQ_BM.V4 file:<BR>
Just replace the '+' sign at the beginning of the parameter name by a '-' sign.</P>
